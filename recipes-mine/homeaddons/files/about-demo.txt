You can either lauch ROS turtlesim demo from console on host or lauch it from weston desktop.  

A good practice is to use tmux to open 2 sessions. Here's the testing scenario:

1. login with root or weston

2. start a tmux session by command : tmux

3. run turtlesim demo by command: ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

Now a turtle will appear on the desktop. To control it with keyboard, you'll need to run the following command:

4. use CTRL+B+C to create another tmux session

5. run command: ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

 
Now you can use the keyboard's arrow keys to control the little turtle forward or backward, as well as change direction.
